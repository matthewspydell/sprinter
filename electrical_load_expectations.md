| Item                 | Power   | Typical Amp Draw | AC or DC |
|---------------------:|:-------:|:----------------:|:--------:|
|Cellphone             |     5W  |         0.417A   |    DC    |
|Computer              |    85W  |          7.08A   |    AC    |
|Nintendo Switch       |   7.5W  |         0.625A   |    AC    |
|Camera                |  16.8W  |           1.4A   |    DC    |
|iPad                  |     5W  |         0.417A   |    DC    |
|LED Interior Lighting |  18.6W  |          1.55A   |    DC    |
|Fridge                |    60W  |             5A   |    DC    |
|Heater                | 14-29W  |     1.17-2.42A   |    DC    |
|Crockpot              |   180W  |            15A   |    AC    |
|Waffle Maker          |   350W  |         29.17A   |    AC    |
|Projector             |   200W  |          16.6A   |    AC    |
|<sup>\*</sup>**Total**|941-957W |   78.42-79.75A   |    N/A   |

<sup>\*</sup>The total is worst case where everything is running

Battery Bank = 400 Ah  
Effective use of battery bank = 200 Ah

Running all electronics will result in 2.5 hours of use. :disappointed:

Only running the fridge will result in 40 hours of use. :smiley:  
<sup>\*</sup>This does not include charging the batteries while driving.
